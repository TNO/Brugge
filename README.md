This data set contains (modified) simulation files, available since 2017, for a single model realization from the Brugge data set. The files and documents of that data set have been prepared for the SPE ATW workshop in June 2008 on Closed-Loop Reservoir Management. In 2012, an addition of the files was prepared.

The files pertain to a reservoir-model based on synthetic data assembled for the fictitious field referred to as “Brugge” and to the definition SPE ATW Closed-Loop Reservoir Management benchmark. All the files, including the simulation files,  are provided on a strict “as is” basis (via www.isapp2.com). TNO does not assume any responsibility or liability for any damage that might result from its use by you. Reasonable changes to the files as proposed by you will be considered by TNO.

Please be aware that these files of the Brugge data set are available to you for non-commercial purposes only. 

If you wish to use thise data for a commercial venture, please contact us first at dries.hegen@tno.nl .
