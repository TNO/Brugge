This repository contains simulation files for a single model realization from the Brugge data set. The files and documents of that data set were prepared for the SPE ATW workshop on Closed-Loop Reservoir Management held in June 2008 in Brugge, Belgium. In 2012 an extended data set was prepared.

The files pertain to a reservoir model based on synthetic data assembled for the fictitious field referred to as “Brugge” and to the definition SPE ATW Closed-Loop Reservoir Management benchmark. All files, including the simulation files,  are provided on a strict “as is” basis. The full data set can be requested via www.isapp2.com. 

TNO does not assume responsibility or liability for any damage that might result from use of these files by others. Reasonable changes to the files as proposed by others will be considered. Please be aware that these files of the Brugge data set are available for non-commercial purposes only. If you wish to use thise data for a commercial venture, please contact us first at dries.hegen@tno.nl.

We ask that you acknowledge TNO in any publications, presentations or reports that use the data set. The references for the summary paper from the original workshop and for the paper describing the extended data set are provided below:
